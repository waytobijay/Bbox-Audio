/**
 * TTS jobs — the asynchronous path used by the public API.
 *
 * Why jobs at all: a Vercel function is capped at 60 seconds and a Modal cold
 * start alone can take most of a minute, so no API request may wait for a
 * render. The client gets a job id immediately and either polls or is called
 * back.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   queued  -> dispatched to a backend
 *   running -> the GPU is rendering
 *   done    -> audio collected into Blob, audio_url set
 *   error   -> something failed; `error` says what, in words
 *
 * Completion is driven by the backend's callback, but never *depends* on it:
 * a poll of a stale running job reconciles against the backend directly. A
 * dropped callback therefore costs a delay, not the render.
