VoiceForge on Modal — the always-available backend.

Why Modal: a permanent HTTPS URL that scales to zero, so it costs nothing
while idle and needs no notebook left open. Deployed automatically from
GitHub by .github/workflows/deploy-modal.yml.

Deploy by hand:
    pip install modal
    modal token new
    modal secret create voiceforge-backend BACKEND_SECRET=<same value as Vercel>
    modal deploy modal/voiceforge_modal.py
